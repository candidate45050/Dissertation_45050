   cd cancer-drug-dashboard
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install streamlit pandas numpy plotly openpyxl
   ```

3. **Prepare data files**
   - Place `DSD_PTD_RY25_P04_V10_DY23_BGM.csv` in the project root
   - Place `price_calculator_data.xlsx` in the project root

4. **Run the dashboard**
   ```bash
   streamlit run cancer_drug_dashboard.py
   ```

   - Open your browser to `http://localhost:8501`

## üìñ Usage Guide

### Getting Started
1. Launch the dashboard using the command above
2. Wait for data loading (progress indicator will show)
3. Review the "Data Sources & Methodology" section for context

### Navigation
- **Drug Selection**: Use the multiselect dropdown to focus on specific drugs
- **Total Cost Tab**: Analyze overall spending and savings by total expenditure
- **Unit Price Tab**: Compare per-dose costs and examine price trends
- **Detailed Breakdowns**: Expand sections for comprehensive data tables

### Key Metrics
- **Total Medicare Spending**: Aggregate spending for matched drugs (2025 adjusted)
- **Cost Plus Alternative**: Potential spending using Cost Plus pricing
- **Savings Analysis**: Both percentage and dollar amount savings calculations
- **Price Trends**: Historical Medicare price changes and growth rates

## üî¨ Methodology

### Data Processing
1. **Medicare Data**: 
   - Filters for "Overall" manufacturer data
   - Adjusts 2023 prices to mid-2025 using inflation multiplier (1.0586)
   - Focuses on drugs where brand name matches generic name

2. **Cost Plus Data**:
   - Calculates unit prices including $5 service fee and 7.52% markup
   - Extracts numeric values from strength and quantity fields

3. **Drug Matching Algorithm**:
   - **Exact matches**: Direct name comparisons
   - **Substring matching**: One name contained in another
   - **Word-level matching**: Jaccard similarity for compound names
   - **Cross-matching**: Drug names vs generic names
   - **Fuzzy matching**: String similarity as fallback

### Savings Calculations
- **Conservative Approach**: Uses maximum Cost Plus prices for minimum savings estimates
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Provides both optimistic (min Cost Plus) and conservative (max Cost Plus) scenarios
- **Inflation Adjustment**: Medicare prices adjusted from 2023 to mid-2025
